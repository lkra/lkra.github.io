Iâ€™m a PhD student at the [Computational Linguistics and Text Mining Lab](http://www.cltl.nl/) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 

I work on the [Make Robots Talk](http://makerobotstalk.nl/) project and I am part of the Explainability track of the [Hybrid Intelligence Centre](https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl/).
My research focuses on the generation and impact of explanations for human-robot interaction, supervised by [Piek Vossen](https://vossen.info/.).

### Research interests:
* Explainability
* Natural language understanding
* Natural language generation
* Human-computer interaction
* Ethics in A.I.

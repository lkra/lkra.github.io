Iâ€™m a PhD student at the [Computational Linguistics and Text Mining Lab](http://www.cltl.nl/) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, supervised by [Piek Vossen](https://vossen.info/.). Prior to this, I received my master's degree in Speech and Language Processing from the University of Edinburgh, my thesis was supervised by [Rico Sennrich](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/people/team/compling/sennrich.html).

From April to June '24 I am working with [Ana Valdivia](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/ana-valdivia/) at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk) on cultural representations in multilingual NLP. 

I currently work on the [Make Robots Talk](http://makerobotstalk.nl/) project, and I am part of the Explainability track of the [Hybrid Intelligence Centre](https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl/).
My research focuses on data-to-text generation for conversational A.I. using knowledge graphs. I specifically look at how to attribute sources and communicate accurate estimates of data and model (un)certainty.

If you have ideas for collaborating (esp. interdisciplinarily), just reach out!

### Research interests:
* Natural language generation
* Robustness
* Ethics in A.I.

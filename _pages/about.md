Iâ€™m a PhD student at the [Computational Linguistics and Text Mining Lab](http://www.cltl.nl/) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Prior to this, I received my master's degree in Speech and Language Processing from the Edinburgh University, my thesis was supervised by [Rico Sennrich](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/people/team/compling/sennrich.html).

I currently work on the [Make Robots Talk](http://makerobotstalk.nl/) project and I am part of the Explainability track of the [Hybrid Intelligence Centre](https://www.hybrid-intelligence-centre.nl/).
My research focuses on the generation and impact of explanations for natural language understanding and human-robot interaction, supervised by [Piek Vossen](https://vossen.info/.).

### Research interests:
* Explainability
* Natural language understanding
* Human-computer interaction
* Ethics in A.I.
